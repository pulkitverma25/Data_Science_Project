METHODOLOGY:
Sample 20 matches from this list using ”Weighted Sampling without replacement”. The weights assigned to matches that are closer to the survey date will be higher so that prediction task becomes easier.

Weighted Sampling where weights are more for matches nearer to current date is used to generate a set of representative tasks. This approach will also eliminate the chances of random guessing for later matches. The weighted sampling is based on http://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/0209009

Note: Since the sampling needs to be done just before the survey, tasks.tsv has 178 matches listed in it.

MULTIPLE CHOICE OPTIONS:
Not Applicable
