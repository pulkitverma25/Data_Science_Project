TASK: Estimate rivers by length.

SHORT DESCRIPTION: Given a set of rivers, estimate their length.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION shown to participants: "We will now ask you a series of questions. For each question, we will show you a River Name, and ask you to estimate its length. A map containing the image will also be shown for your help. You will have to fill your estimate in the box provided. Please note that the length should be given in kilometre (km)"

INPUT TYPE: Image and Text

CORPUS: 
Wikipediaâ€™s "List of rivers by length"

Modified Corpus: 

METHODOLOGY:
TASKS
We will sample 20 questions out of a Dataset by:
1. We will first chose the rivers whose images are available. We will then create a new corpus of rivers whose complete information is available with us. Then we will sample it on the basis of river length. We found that rivers with more length are generally more famous.

2. Final sampling will be weighted on the basis of river length. 

Note: A error rate within 1% will be considered acceptable as most people will not predict the exact length of the river. This error range can be extended to 2% or 3%.

MULTIPLE CHOICE OPTIONS:
Not Applicable
